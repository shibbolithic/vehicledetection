## Introduction

Vehicle detection is an essential task in various applications such as autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and surveillance systems. This project focuses on building a deep-learning model capable of accurately detecting vehicles in images.

## Installation

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/vehicle-detection.git

##Usage

After installing the dependencies and downloading the dataset, you can use the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images containing vehicles and non-vehicles. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

##Model Architecture

The model architecture employed for vehicle detection is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It comprises several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with dense layers for classification. The model is compiled using the Adamax optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

##Training

Training of the CNN model is performed using the training data with dynamic learning rate adjustment based on training and validation performance. Custom callbacks are implemented to monitor training progress and adjust learning rates accordingly.

##Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the training, validation, and test sets using metrics such as loss and accuracy. Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to analyze model performance in detail.

##Prediction

Once trained, the model can make predictions on new images to detect vehicles. Predictions are made using the test set, and the results are analyzed to assess the model's effectiveness.

##Analysis

In-depth analysis of the model's performance is conducted, including visualization of training history, examination of confusion matrix, and generation of classification report.

##Saving

The trained model and its weights are saved for future use. Additionally, class indices and image size information are stored in CSV files for reference.
