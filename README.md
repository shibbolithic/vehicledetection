3. Open the Jupyter notebook `vehicle_detection.ipynb` to access the code and execute it in your preferred environment.

## Usage

The notebook `vehicle_detection.ipynb` contains the entire workflow of the vehicle detection project. You can run each cell sequentially to replicate the experiments and results presented in the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images containing various vehicles. It is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set) and contains labeled examples of vehicles and non-vehicles.

## Model Architecture

The vehicle detection model architecture consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. It also includes fully connected layers for classification. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Training

The training process involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The model is trained on the training set and validated on the validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. Training parameters such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate are optimized during training.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix. This helps assess the model's ability to correctly classify vehicles in unseen images.

## Prediction

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set to assess its real-world performance. Predictions are visualized, and performance metrics are computed to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Analysis

An analysis of the model's performance and insights gained from the training and evaluation process are provided. This includes discussions on areas of improvement and future directions for the project.

## Saving

The trained model weights and architecture can be saved for future use. Additionally, CSV files containing class indices and image sizes are generated for reference.
